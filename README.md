# TreyBot is an AI that tries to guess your number.  

He'll start by guessing zero, and then randomly choose to either: Add 1, Subtract 1, Multiply by 2, or Divide by 2. If the new guess is closer to your target number, TreyBot will be more likely to choose the operation that brought him closer in the future.  

TreyBot has 100 guesses.  If he can't get your number in that many, he loses.  The bigger the number, the harder it is for TreyBot to guess. 

This program was my first attempt at any sort of Object Oriented Programming or AI.  It was a lot of fun to make, though i'm sure it isn't perfect.  

Update[1/8/2019]: I've now learned how OOP actually works and I can say for certain that my implementation of it here is absolutely wrong. 
However, the program does work!  If I were to rewrite it, instead of making each operation its own "Class", i'd instead make one "TreyBot" class, with the required methods contained within it.  Since, you know, that's sort of the whole point of OOP. 

In any case, this was a lot of fun to make and does work. For now i'm leaving it as is so that I can look back and document how i've improved over time.  Sort of how TreyBot does. :)
