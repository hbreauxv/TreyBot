TreyBot is an AI that tries to guess your number.  He'll start by guessing zero, and then randomly choose to either: Add 1, Subtract 1, Multiply by 2, or Divide by 2. If the new guess is closer to your target number, TreyBot will be more likely to choose the operation that brought him closer in the future.  

TreyBot has 100 guesses.  If he can't get your number in that many, he loses.  The bigger the number, the harder it is for TreyBot to guess.
